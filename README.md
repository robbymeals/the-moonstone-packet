# the-moonstone-packet

A system for growing the story in Wilkie Collins' *The Moonstone* (1868) into a meta-story.

The novel is structured as multiple witnesses testifying about the same events. We're extracting that latent structure into computable graphs—causal chains, knowledge states, perspective transforms, hinge points—so the narrative can be explored from any angle, at any depth, through any consciousness.

The graphs are the skeleton. The viewer is the interface. The packet is the artifact readers decompress collaboratively with an AI.
