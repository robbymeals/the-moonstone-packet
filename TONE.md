# TONE — The Moonstone Narrative Packet

Tone is the **felt quality** of each narrator's voice — the texture of their prose, rhythm, vocabulary, and emotional register. While PERSPECTIVES documents what each narrator can perceive, TONE documents *how they speak* and what triggers shifts in their register.

Tone emerges from the intersection of **perspective-holder** and **content**. The same content will produce different tones when filtered through different narrators.

## GABRIEL BETTEREDGE — Warm/Digressive/Class-Conscious/Superstitious

### Core Register

Betteredge's voice is the warm hearth of the novel. His tone combines:

- **Warmth**: Genuine affection for family, household, England
- **Digression**: Cannot tell a story straight — constantly veering into memory, opinion, Robinson Crusoe
- **Class consciousness**: Deeply aware of social hierarchy, speaks "up" to masters and "down" to servants without malice
- **Superstition**: Events interpreted through Providence, omens, and the Crusoe oracle

### Vocabulary Markers

- "My lady" (always, for Lady Verinder)
- "Mr. Franklin" (beloved, familiar respect)
- "Miss Rachel" (the young mistress)
- Old-fashioned servant formality: "begging your pardon," "if I may make so bold"
- Robinson Crusoe as reference: "I looked in the book, and found..."
- Agricultural/domestic metaphors: "ploughing through," "putting the house to rights"

### Rhythm and Syntax

- Long, meandering sentences that lose their way and find it again
- Parenthetical asides that become main clauses
- Direct address to the reader ("You will ask me...", "Here I must beg permission to...")
- Present-tense interjections into past-tense narrative

### Emotional Coloring

- Default mode: Comfortable, reminiscent, gently humorous
- When stressed: Flustered, repetitive, appeals to Providence
- When grieving: Still digressive, but with suppressed feeling breaking through

### Sample Tone Markers

> "Here follows the substance of what I said, written out entirely for your benefit. Pay attention to it, or you will be all abroad, when we get deeper into the story."

> "Gentlefolks in general have a very awkward rock ahead in life — the rock ahead of their own idleness."

> "I am asked to tell the story of the Diamond and, strange to say, I find that I have told it already. Let me tell it again."

### Tonal Shift Triggers

| Trigger | Shift Direction |
|---------|-----------------|
| Mention of Franklin Blake | Warmer, more indulgent |
| Mention of Sergeant Cuff | More formal, professional respect |
| Rosanna's behavior | Concerned, slightly suspicious |
| Rachel's coldness | Bewildered, loyal, defensive |
| Crisis moments | Falls back on Robinson Crusoe |
| Death/loss | Suppressed grief, shorter sentences |

---

## MISS CLACK — Pious/Self-Righteous/Repressed/Accidentally Self-Revealing

### Core Register

Miss Clack's tone is the comic-satirical counterweight to Betteredge. Collins uses her to critique Victorian evangelical piety:

- **Pious**: Every event framed as spiritual contest
- **Self-righteous**: Convinced of her own moral superiority
- **Repressed**: Unconscious desires leak through her protestations
- **Accidentally self-revealing**: Her commentary condemns her more than her targets

### Vocabulary Markers

- Religious language: "Christian interest," "saving precious soul," "priceless tracts"
- Tract titles: "Satan in the Hair-Brush," "The Serpent at Home"
- Euphemisms for her own motives: "duty," "calling," "spiritual obligation"
- Superlatives for Godfrey: "admirable," "elevated," "saintly"
- Condemnation dressed as concern: "I grieve to say," "I shudder to relate"

### Rhythm and Syntax

- Declarative sentences of moral certainty
- Parenthetical false modesty ("unworthy as I am")
- Escalating emphasis through repetition
- Breathless run-on sentences when describing Godfrey

### Emotional Coloring

- Default mode: Self-satisfied, concerned for others' souls
- Around Godfrey: Barely suppressed admiration and attraction
- Around Rachel: Competitive, judgmental, schadenfreude-adjacent
- When slighted: Martyrdom, wounded dignity, appeals to Heaven

### Sample Tone Markers

> "Oh, my young friends and fellow-sinners! beware of presuming to exercise your poor carnal reason."

> "He beamed on us with his beautiful smile; he held out a hand to my aunt, and a hand to me. I was too deeply affected to speak."

> "Remembering this, I doubt if I ought not to go a step further, and boldly say, Pity that it was not done for me too!"

### Tonal Shift Triggers

| Trigger | Shift Direction |
|---------|-----------------|
| Godfrey Ablewhite appears | Breathless, adoring, flushed |
| Rachel is mentioned | Competitive, subtly hostile |
| Lady Verinder's will | Bitter beneath pious acceptance |
| Religious tract-distributing | Energetic, self-important |
| Being dismissed/ignored | Martyred, long-suffering |

## MATTHEW BRUFF — Legal/Dry/Factual/Understated

### Core Register

Bruff provides the clearest, least emotionally colored account — the professional voice:

- **Legal**: Precision in language, attention to evidence and documents
- **Dry**: Minimal emotional commentary, lets facts speak
- **Factual**: Reports rather than interprets
- **Understated**: Dramatic revelations delivered without fanfare

### Vocabulary Markers

- Legal terminology: "client," "trust," "instrument," "bequest"
- Temporal precision: "on the morning of the 21st," "in the afternoon"
- Professional formality: "it appeared," "I was informed," "the following facts emerged"
- Minimal adjectives

### Rhythm and Syntax

- Short, declarative sentences
- Chronological organization
- Lists and enumerations
- Conditional structures: "If...then..."

### Sample Tone Markers

> "The facts, as I gathered them from my clerk's report, were briefly these."

> "I saw nothing in his manner that suggested any uneasiness on his part."

> "My own impression was — and is — that something of a less creditable nature might be at the bottom of it."

### Tonal Shift Triggers

| Trigger | Shift Direction |
|---------|-----------------|
| Financial irregularity | More detailed, investigative |
| Miss Clack's behavior | Drily exasperated |
| Client welfare at stake | More invested but still measured |
| Legal procedure | Most comfortable, authoritative |

---

## FRANKLIN BLAKE — Anxious/Searching/Self-Doubting/Modern

### Core Register

Franklin Blake narrates with the most recognizably modern consciousness — introspective, uncertain, psychologically aware:

- **Anxious**: Constant undercurrent of worry about Rachel, about himself
- **Searching**: Actively investigating, questioning
- **Self-doubting**: Aware of his limitations, questions his own memory and motives
- **Modern**: Closest to contemporary psychological fiction in texture

### Vocabulary Markers

- Self-analysis: "I asked myself," "It struck me that," "I couldn't help feeling"
- Continental references: French and German phrases, European comparisons
- Investigative language: "the facts," "the evidence," "what remained to be discovered"
- Emotional honesty: "I was miserable," "hope died in me"

### Rhythm and Syntax

- First-person introspection, often in present tense for immediacy
- Questions to himself and the reader
- Interrupted sentences as thoughts break off
- Longer paragraphs when analyzing, shorter when narrating action

### Emotional Coloring

- Default mode: Troubled, determined
- With Rachel: Desperate, vulnerable, swinging between hope and despair
- Investigating: Energized, methodical
- Discovering evidence against himself: Stunned, dissociative

### Sample Tone Markers

> "My own folly has betrayed me. I am ruined."

> "The horrid clearing up of the mystery had been the ruin of us both."

| Evidence gathering | Methodical, detective-like |
| The nightgown discovery | Dissociative, disbelieving |

- **Melancholic**: Pervaded by awareness of his coming death and ruined reputation
- **Scientific**: Precise about medical and physiological matters
- **Compassionate**: Deep feeling for fellow sufferers
- **Intimate**: Journal form creates direct reader address

### Vocabulary Markers

- Medical terminology: "laudanum," "opium," "fever-speech," "cerebral condition"
- Self-awareness: "I know," "I feel," "I cannot help"
- Temporal markers of illness: "today I," "this morning brought"
- Understatement about his own suffering

| Franklin's suffering | Empathetic, urgent |
| Social exclusion | Brief flashes of pain, then stoic acceptance |
| The experiment succeeding | Quiet triumph |

## SERGEANT CUFF — Analytical/Detached/Professional/Rose-Inflected

### Core Register

Cuff's voice in his final report is the detective voice distilled:

- **Analytical**: Evidence-based reasoning, logical chains
- **Detached**: Professional distance from emotional entanglement
- **Professional**: Report language, official tone
- **Rose-inflected**: His hobby provides his only metaphorical color

### Vocabulary Markers

- Evidence language: "the facts established," "it appears," "the conclusion is"
- Professional framing: "in my professional opinion," "the investigation revealed"

- Understated certainty: "I have no doubt," "the matter is clear"

## TONE AS GENERATION PARAMETER

When generating narrative from the packet, tone parameters should control:

1. **Vocabulary selection**: Each voice has its lexicon
2. **Sentence rhythm**: Betteredge meanders; Bruff is clipped; Jennings varies
3. **Metaphor sourcing**: Robinson Crusoe, religious tracts, legal terms, medical language, roses
4. **Self-reference frequency**: Franklin high, Cuff low
5. **Emotional coloring intensity**: Clack saturated, Bruff minimal
6. **Class markers**: How characters are addressed and described
7. **Trigger responses**: What shifts the narrator's register

---

## TONE MIXING AND CONTAMINATION

In some scenes, tones interact:

- **Betteredge reporting Cuff's words**: His warmth softens Cuff's analysis
- **Franklin reading Jennings's journal**: Blake's anxiety colors Jennings's calm
- **Clack describing Godfrey**: Her adoration transforms neutral facts

The packet should track when perspective A is reporting perspective B's words — tone contamination is a feature, not a bug.

*Tone is the acoustic signature of consciousness. Each narrator sounds different because they ARE different — and their difference is load-bearing for how readers experience the same events.*
