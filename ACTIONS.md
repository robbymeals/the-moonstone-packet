Guests present include: Rachel Verinder (birthday celebrant), Lady Verinder, Franklin Blake, Godfrey Ablewhite, Mr. Candy (local doctor), Mr. Murthwaite (traveler who knows India), Miss Clack [time uncertain], and other relations and neighbors.
- **[During dinner]**: Franklin Blake presents Rachel with the Moonstone as the birthday gift from her late uncle. Rachel is delighted; she wears the diamond.
- **[During dinner]**: Mr. Murthwaite examines the diamond and recounts its history — its sacred origin, the curse, and the dedication of the Brahmin guardians.

- **[Late evening]**: Rachel decides to keep the diamond in her sitting-room, in an Indian cabinet. The sitting-room door has been freshly painted that day; the paint is still wet.
- **[~11:00 PM]**: Guests begin departing.
- **[~Midnight]**: The last guests leave. Household begins retiring.
- **[Post-midnight]**: Franklin Blake is restless, unable to sleep. He has been abstaining from tobacco (at Rachel's request), which affects his nerves.
- **[Post-midnight, time uncertain]**: Dr. Candy, annoyed by Franklin's dismissal of medicine during dinner conversation, secretly gives Franklin a dose of laudanum (opium dissolved in liquid) without Franklin's knowledge. [The exact mechanism of delivery is unclear — possibly via a nightcap or other beverage.]
- **[~1:00 AM, time uncertain]**: Under the influence of laudanum, Franklin Blake rises from bed in a trance-like state.
- **[~1:00–2:00 AM]**: Franklin Blake walks to Rachel's sitting-room.
- **[~1:00–2:00 AM]**: Rachel Verinder, unable to sleep, witnesses Franklin enter her sitting-room from a concealed position.

- **[~1:00–2:00 AM]**: Franklin Blake's nightgown brushes against the wet paint on the door, leaving a paint smear on the fabric.
- **[~1:00–2:00 AM]**: Rachel observes this entire sequence but does not intervene, believing Franklin must have a private reason. She decides to protect him by remaining silent.
- **[~1:00–2:00 AM]**: Franklin Blake, still in the laudanum trance, returns toward his room. [His exact actions with the diamond at this point are unclear to him.]

- Rachel Verinder is now an orphan and an heiress.
- Godfrey Ablewhite pays court to Rachel. [He is in debt and needs her fortune.]

**Early 1849**

- Rachel briefly becomes engaged to Godfrey Ablewhite.
- Rachel breaks the engagement after a private conversation with him. [Details unknown — she may have sensed his mercenary motives.]
- Franklin Blake returns to England.
- Franklin encounters Rachel; their estrangement continues. She refuses to explain her hostility.
- Franklin begins his own investigation into the theft.

**May–June 1849**

- Franklin seeks Sergeant Cuff's advice; Cuff cannot explain the memory gap.

**June 1849 — Ezra Jennings's Discovery**

- Franklin visits Ezra Jennings, the assistant to Dr. Candy.
- Dr. Candy has been severely ill since June 1848 (caught fever after the birthday dinner, rode home in the rain). His mind is damaged.
- Ezra Jennings reveals he has been recording Dr. Candy's delirious fever-ramblings, attempting to reconstruct coherent thoughts.
- Jennings's reconstruction reveals: Dr. Candy secretly administered laudanum to Franklin Blake on the night of June 21, 1848, as a "joke" to prove the power of medicine after Franklin's skeptical dinner remarks.
- This explains Franklin's memory gap — he took the diamond while in a laudanum-induced trance.

## 5. OPIUM EXPERIMENT (June 1849)

**June 24–25, 1849 — Setup**

- Ezra Jennings proposes an experiment: recreate the exact conditions of the birthday night and administer the same dose of laudanum to Franklin.
- If Franklin's body re-enacts the actions under opium influence, it will prove he took the diamond unconsciously.
- Franklin agrees.
- The experiment is arranged at the Verinder house with witnesses present, including: Mr. Bruff (family lawyer), Betteredge, Ezra Jennings, and others.
- Rachel Verinder is secretly present, concealed, to witness.
- The sitting-room is restored to its exact state on the birthday night: furniture arrangement, lighting, even the Indian cabinet in position.
- A substitute "diamond" is placed in the cabinet.

**June 25, 1849 — Night of the Experiment**

- **[~11:00 PM]**: Franklin Blake is put through the evening routine matching the birthday night. He abstains from tobacco as before.
- **[~Midnight]**: Ezra Jennings administers laudanum to Franklin Blake — the same dose Dr. Candy originally gave.
- **[~12:30 AM–1:30 AM]**: Witnesses wait and observe.
- **[~1:30 AM, time uncertain]**: Franklin Blake rises from bed in a trance-like state, exactly as on the original night.
- **[~1:30–2:00 AM]**: Franklin walks to the sitting-room.
- **[~1:30–2:00 AM]**: Franklin opens the Indian cabinet, removes the substitute object.
- **[~1:30–2:00 AM]**: Rachel, watching from concealment, sees Franklin replicate his original actions exactly.
- **[~2:00 AM]**: The experiment proves Franklin took the diamond while unconscious. He acted on the anxiety about protecting it that dominated his waking thoughts.
- **[Post-experiment]**: Rachel now understands Franklin's innocence — he had no conscious knowledge of taking the diamond.
- **[Post-experiment]**: Rachel and Franklin reconcile. The estrangement ends.
- **[Remaining question]**: If Franklin took the diamond to his room unconsciously, who removed it afterward?

## 6. RESOLUTION (June 1849)

**June 26–27, 1849 — The Diamond's Journey**

- The one-year pledge term expires. Mr. Luker can now release the diamond.
- The three Indians position themselves to watch Mr. Luker's movements.
- Sergeant Cuff (now working privately for Mr. Bruff) also watches Mr. Luker.
- **[June 26, Daytime]**: Mr. Luker goes to his bank and retrieves the Moonstone from the safe deposit.
- **[June 26, Afternoon/Evening]**: Mr. Luker transfers the Moonstone to a person who redeems the pledge — a man in sailor's disguise.
- **[June 26, Evening]**: The man in sailor's disguise is Godfrey Ablewhite.
- **[June 26, Night]**: Godfrey Ablewhite takes a room at a low inn near the river, "The Wheel of Fortune," planning to leave England.
- **[June 26–27, Night]**: The three Indians track Godfrey to the inn.

- **[June 27, ~2:00–4:00 AM]**: The Indians escape the inn and flee London.

**June 27, 1849 — Discovery**

- **[Morning]**: Godfrey Ablewhite's body is discovered at the inn. He is dead, disguised as a sailor.
- **[Morning]**: The sailor disguise is removed, revealing Godfrey Ablewhite.
- **[Daytime]**: Investigation reveals Godfrey Ablewhite's double life: he had embezzled a large sum from a trust fund (money belonging to a young man whose guardian he was). The diamond pledge to Luker covered this theft.
- **[Daytime]**: The full truth emerges: Godfrey saw Franklin (in his laudanum trance) take the diamond; Godfrey took it from Franklin's room while Franklin was unconscious; Godfrey pledged it to Luker and planned to sell it when he could reclaim it.
- **[Daytime]**: The Moonstone is not recovered from the scene — the Indians have it.

**Aftermath — 1849–1850**

- During the ceremony, Murthwaite sees the Moonstone restored to its place in the forehead of the idol.
- The three Brahmin guardians (now elderly) are present. Their sacred duty is complete.
- The diamond has returned to its origin after fifty-one years.

## CAUSAL CHAIN SUMMARY

The actual sequence of causation:

1. Herncastle steals the Moonstone (1799) → Brahmins begin generational pursuit
2. Herncastle bequeaths diamond to Rachel (1848) → Franklin brings it to Verinder house
3. Dr. Candy drugs Franklin with laudanum (June 21, 1848) → Franklin takes diamond unconsciously
4. Rachel witnesses Franklin take diamond → She protects him through silence
5. Godfrey observes Franklin or finds diamond → Godfrey steals it from Franklin's room
6. Godfrey pledges diamond to Luker → Diamond locked away for one year
7. Rosanna finds Franklin's stained nightgown → She hides evidence to protect him → She kills herself
8. Investigation stalls → Franklin goes abroad → Estrangement persists
9. Jennings reconstructs Candy's secret → Opium experiment reveals truth
10. Rachel understands Franklin's innocence → Reconciliation
11. Pledge expires → Godfrey reclaims diamond → Indians kill Godfrey, take diamond
12. Diamond returns to India → Cycle completes
